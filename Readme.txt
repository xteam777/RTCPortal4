1.) License Agreement
---------------------

Please read the RTC Portal License Agreement before using RTC Portal.

You will find the RTC Portal License Agreement in the "License.txt" file.

2.) INSTALLING Portal components and COMPILING Portal Demos
--------------------------------------------------------

RTC Portal is compatible with Delphi 7 - XE3 for the Win32 platform.

To be able to open and compile the RTC Portal projects, you 
need to install the RTC SDK and RTC Portal components.

Please unpack all RTC Portal files into a folder of your choice.

If you already have the full RTC SDK version installed, do NOT add "LibSDK" 
to the Library path and do NOT install rtcSDK package from the RTC Portal zip.

To make RTC SDK and RTC Portal Lib files accessible from all RTC Portal projects,
select "Tools / Environment Options" from the Delphi menu, then open the "Library" 
tab and add the full path to the "Lib" and "LibSDK" folders as "Library path".

Once you are finished with the above setup, open the PortalPackages_Main Group,
build and install the rtcSDK package, then build and install the rtcPortal package.

After that, you will be able to compile all projects from the "Demos" folder.
